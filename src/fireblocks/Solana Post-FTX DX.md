# Solana Post-FTX DX

## Objective

Analyze how Solana’s developer experience (DX) initiatives contributed to its recovery and ecosystem growth after the FTX collapse. The goal is to identify specific programs, tools, and incentives that directly supported developer adoption and retention—and determine which elements could be adapted for Hedera to strengthen its developer onboarding and community engagement.

## Research Scope

1. DX Strategy & Community Programs

- Document Solana’s Superteam model (governance, funding, geographic reach).
- Analyze how Solana structured hackathons (Colosseum, prize pools, accelerators) to drive developer engagement.
- Identify the role of DAOs and grants in sustaining builder ecosystems.

2. Incentive Design & Outcomes

- Explore how airdrops, meme campaigns (BONK, WIF), and retail-friendly tools (pump.fun) tied into developer incentives.
- Review KPIs Solana used to track success (e.g., active developers, hackathon project retention, ecosystem funding).

3. Tooling & Developer Onboarding

- Evaluate the developer toolchain (SDKs, Playground, CLIs) that reduced onboarding friction.
- Assess whether consolidated onboarding flows (e.g., Superteam Earn, curated starter kits) increased project completion rates.

4. Growth Impact

- Identify how these DX efforts correlated with wallet growth, TVL, and ecosystem health.
- Highlight case studies where Solana’s DX directly led to high-impact projects.

5. Lessons for Hedera

- Compare Hedera’s current DX and onboarding gaps to Solana’s structure.
- Propose 3–5 pilot initiatives (e.g., Hedera Superteam model, hackathon-in-a-box, unified onboarding portal) with measurable goals.

## Deliverables

1. A 3–5 page research summary detailing Solana’s DX initiatives, their execution, and results.
2. A DX gap analysis comparing Hedera vs. Solana’s onboarding experience.
3. A list of actionable recommendations (3–5) for Hedera to strengthen its developer journey, with potential quick wins.

## Key Questions

- Which DX initiatives had the highest measurable impact on Solana’s recovery and growth?
- How did Superteams and community-led efforts like hackathons drive new developers to ship projects?
- What incentive models (grants, airdrops, bootcamps) retained developers long-term?
- How could Hedera consolidate its scattered resources (Docs, Playground, Hashgraph Course) into a streamlined onboarding path?
- Which community personas (enterprise vs. retail) did Solana prioritize, and what lessons apply to Hedera?
